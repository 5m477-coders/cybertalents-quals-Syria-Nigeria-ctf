This one was web chellange with medium difficulty
I spent some effort on this one but it was very fun
So lets begin :D

at first glance while u still exploring the chellange you see the link to [the chellange](http://ec2-54-93-122-202.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/404/)
and the phrase **Sometimes you should see all the request faces!**

Burp suite scope is set to the chellange and started surfing it
the default page is a page indicating 404 error with a link to direct the user to a contact admin page

I started the directory brute forcing with burp suite before anything
then I checked the contact admin page which had an email and first 5 digits of a phone number with 9 digits missing

first I thought of searching for this email in some leaked databases but no result
the phone number is worthless because it's not complete..

after few minutes the brute force got a result for a login page
the login form had three parameters:
-username
-password
-access (which was hidden and set to admin
I tried to sql inject it but with no result
tried to brute force with username admin and a password list but no result too
I was stuck in this step
I took a little break to clear my mind and returned and reviewed what's happened from the beginning to see if I'm missing something
the read the phrase at the chellange beginning **Sometimes you should see all the request faces!**
and I realized that it's a hint !
so I went to the chellange link and changed the request method to POST instead of GET and I got what I'm looking for :D
There's a comment appeared in the page source code containing MD5 hash `c54f73655a0d69605e24980a0e055b94`

The first thing I do with MD5 hashed is cracking it with rainbow tables sites
I tried to crack this hash using 4 sites but non of them fount a result
I was stuck for a while and didn't know how to crack this hash
until that **ask google** idea raise on my mind
google never failed me xD
so I searched with the same hash in google engine in hope to find some result for it 
and my hope was in the place
thanks google I found a list with cracked MD5 hashes which contained the required hash 
and the value of the hash was **p4ssw0rD**

and finally I got the password!

the next step is to login and hoping this is the last trick on this chellange
I logged in with username **admin** and password **p4ssw0rD**
and this page appeared

I was hoping that there's no more tricks but this one wasn't an obstacle
i know which value to change to access as a user

I returned to the login page and logged in again with the same user and password and intercepted the request with Burp to change the access parameter from admin to user
`username=admin&password=p4ssw0rD&access=user`

**And BINGO!!**
